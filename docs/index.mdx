## Try it

Explore the [Web Demo](https://jamesblasco.github.io/modal_bottom_sheet/#/) or clone the repository. 

Why not `showModalBottomSheet`?

Inspired by `showModalBottomSheet`, it completes with some must-need features:

- Support for inside scrollview + dragging down to close (`showModalBottomSheet` won't work correctly with scrollviews. 
- Support for `WillPopScope` to prevent closing the dialog.
- Support for scroll to top when tapping status bar (iOS only)
- Cupertino modal bottom sheet
- Create custom modal bottom sheet
